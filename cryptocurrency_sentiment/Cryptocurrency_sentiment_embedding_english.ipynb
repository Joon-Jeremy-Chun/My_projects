This data set of tweets are related to the stock market. We collected 943,672 tweets between April 9 and July 16, 2020, using the S&P 500 tag (#SPX500), the references to the top 25 companies in the S&P 500 index, and the Bloomberg tag (#stocks). __1,300 out of the 943,672 tweets were manually annotated in positive, neutral, or negative classes.__ A second independent annotator reviewed the manually annotated tweets. This annotated data set can contribute to create new domain-specific lexicons or enrich some of the actual dictionaries. Researchers can train their supervised models using the annotated data set. Additionally, the full data set can be used for text mining and sentiment analysis related to the stock
