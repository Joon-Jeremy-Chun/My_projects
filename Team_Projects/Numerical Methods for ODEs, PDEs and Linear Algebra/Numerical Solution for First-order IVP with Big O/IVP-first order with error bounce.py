#  1. By computing its truncation error, determine the order of accuracy of the Midpoint
#  method.
#  2. Implement the Midpoint method with h = 0.01 to approximate the solution to the
#  above IVP and compare it with the exact solution.
#  3. Plot the approximate solution given by the Midpoint method and the exact solution
#  curve on the same window. Be sure to label your curves.
#  4. Compute the absolute error at each time step. Your output should include the print
#  out of approximate value, exact value, and absolute error at each time step.
#  5. Use your code to verify the order of accuracy of the Midpoint method (see notes on
#  Order of Accuracy on how to do this) and compare it with your theoretical result
#  obtained in #1.
